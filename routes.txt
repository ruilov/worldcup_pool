Auth

/auth – email input to request a magic link; lightweight copy about how it works and a “send link” action.
/auth/link-sent – confirmation + resend option; explain to check email;
/auth/verify – handler for the magic-link callback (reads token, completes sign-in, shows spinner/inline error, then routes home).
/challenges – good home for the authed shell. List challenges the user is in; can later link into details.
/account – shows current email, offers “log out on this device” and optionally “log out on all devices”.
/500 – friendly screen for invalid/expired link or network/auth errors, with a path back to request a new link.

Two extra pages you’ll probably want with magic links

“Request a new link” (resend) — /auth/resend (or built into /auth + /auth/check-email)
“Invite requires email” (if you want the invite to bind to an email before account exists) — can be a state inside /i/:inviteCode
